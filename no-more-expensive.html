            <h2>Say Goodbye to Expensive AHCs</h2>
            <p>When you use our Pet Passport service, you avoid the costly AHC (Animal Health Certificate) that is necessary to enter the EU from the UK and is only valid for 4 months. Our passport option is a cost-effective, government-approved alternative. Vets in the UK cannot issue EU Pet Passports</p>

            <h2>How It Saves You Money</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ No need to pay for another AHC at the vet</li>
                <li>✅ One-time payment for a passport that lasts for multiple trips</li>
                <li>✅ Transparent, affordable service with no hidden costs</li>
                <br/>
                <li>✅From 50€ + IVA (VAT) per EU Pet Passport (inc. up to 15Km radious from Torremolinos. Discounts available)                                      
                   
            </ul>
            <p>(*)UK rabies vaccination is usually valid for 3 years for re-entry. Andalucía requires a yearly vaccination</p>
            <p>(**) Equinococcus treatment for re-entry needs to be given and certified by a veterinarian in a 24-120h window before re-entry</p>
